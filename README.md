## Files

It provides routes for logging in, signing up, and logging out, with user emails encrypted for security. Users can view, buy, and sell cat images, with transactions and ownership tracked via a blockchain like system. The application includes functionality for editing cat images, viewing transaction history, and ensuring secure token transactions. It protects sensitive routes using session management and a login_required decorator.
