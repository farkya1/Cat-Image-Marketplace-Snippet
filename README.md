# Cat-Image-Marketplace-Snippet

A web-based cat image marketplace leveraging HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the front-end to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. To dynamically render HTML content based on user-specific data, I utilized Jinja templates within Flask. On the back-end, I implemented a robust system using Python and Flask, which facilitated user logins, image uploads, and comprehensive database management for cat image listings and exchanges. Additionally, I integrated a blockchain approach to ensure the security and integrity of transactions and image ownership, enhancing the overall reliability and trustworthiness of the marketplace.
