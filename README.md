The project utilizes Python for its backend, featuring a MySQL database to manage user accounts, NFTs, and transactions. Data security is ensured through one-way hashing for passwords and reversible encryption for other sensitive information. The web framework Flask handles user requests and integrates with the database, while Jinja templates render dynamic HTML content based on user data and application state.
